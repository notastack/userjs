The Ecosia community has already planted millions of trees in Ethiopia, Brazil, Indonesia, Spain, as well as many other biodiversity hotspots.\n\n➤ Privacy, not just promises\n\nWe're interested in trees, not your data: we don’t save your searches, we don’t track the websites you visit, we don’t sell your data to advertisers, and your searches are always SSL-encrypted.\n\n➤ CO2 positive\n\nCO2 neutral is not enough. Thanks to our solar plant and the Ecosia forests around the world, each of your searches removes around 1 kg of CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\n➤ Radical transparency\n\nTrust has to be earned. That’s why we publish our monthly financial reports and tree-planting receipts on our website. We also signed a legal contract that requires us to stay true to our not-for-profit cause, forever.\n\n♡ Get the Firefox Add-on today.
